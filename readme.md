# node-unblocker

A web proxy for evading corporate or government filters, similar to CGIproxy / PHProxy / Glype but 
written in node.js. All data is processed and relayed to the client on the fly without unnecessary 
buffering.

Any website that the proxy can access can now be reached by the proxy's users.
